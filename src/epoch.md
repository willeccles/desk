For quite some time, I have considered writing various types of content: prose,
blog post-esque content, reviews, and so on. This is unlikely to be a frequent
occurrence, but I would like to start writing things a bit more going forward as
a way to relax. After conversing with a few friends, I decided to make a website
specifically for posting things I write. I'd like to do some short stories, as
well as some more informative content.

This particular post is quite short, and is simply an introduction. Come back in
the future for future content (if any)! This site is statically generated and
does not require any client-side scripting, so it's very accessible to anyone
and should be visible on just about any platform you can think of.
